# Assignment 2

Write a scala program that will prompt the user for four real numbers, and print the average of those 4 numbers.

Sample run on my computer (user input is in **bold**):

Please enter 4 numbers.
**3.45**
**77.89**
**342.0**
**9.8**
The average is 108.28500000000001

Please include a comment at the top of the program with your name and the date.

EXTRA CREDIT: Round off the average to 2 decimal places when you print! The final line would then be:

The average is 108.29
