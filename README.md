### Course Description
This course is an introduction to computer programming. While we will be studying the Scala programming language, we will be focusing on good programming practice and introductory problem solving techniques that will provide you with the tools to write effcient correct code in *any* programming language. This course is *not* just a programming course! Students prepare for each class/module by completing outside work (videos, readings, quizzes, etc) and spend class time synchronously working in groups on activities. When learning to program, there is no substitute to writing code, and we will spend as much time as possible doing that this semester.

### Course Goals
There are three primary objectives for this course. The first is that we cover the syntax of a highlevel programming language. Second, we need to gain experience writing programs in that language. Finally, we need to develop structured thinking/problem solving skills. This final objective is, fundamentally, the most important. By the end of this course you should be able to write clear, concise programs in *Scala*. More importantly, you should be able to translate those skills to any programming language you learn in the future.

### Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of the course, the student should be able to:
- Discuss the challenges inherent in communicating with (programming) a (non-reasoning) computer;
- Break a complex problem down into smaller more manageable components;
- Provide step-by-step instructions to solve small computational problems;
- Using at least one programming language, write examples of and solve problems in programs with the following basic programming constructs and tools:
    - mathematical expressions,
    - conditional expressions,
    - simple iterative statements,
    - simple functions, and
    - simple data structures, such as arrays, lists, and strings; and
- Discuss the importance of commenting and good code structure and style.

### Grades and Grading Policy
Grades will be assigned as per University policy. I will use the following allocation of points:
    
    Programs 60%
    Videos 10%
    Quizzes 20%
    Attendance 10%

Please note the following with respect to the grading of the programs: They will be submitted to an autograder on Mimir (https://class.mimir.io). You can submit each assignment as many times as you want, so there is no reason not to get a great score! Your program will be graded based on whether it produces specific output based on provided input, so be careful!
